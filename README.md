Installing Pip on Windows


Step 3: Installing Pip on Windows

Once you have confirmed that Python is installed correctly, we can proceed with installing Pip.

    Download get-pip.py to a folder on your computer.
    Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the get-pip.py installer.
    Run the following command:
```
python get-pip.py
```
Pip should now be installed successfully. If we receive a “file not found” error, double check the directory path to the file. 
You can use the dir command to view the entire contents of a directory. It should be noted that Pip is installed by default with 
Python versions Python 2.7.9+ and Python 3.4+. As a side note, Pip also sets up both the virtualenv and pyvenv virtual environments when installed.
